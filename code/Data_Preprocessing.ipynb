    "Punctuations have some significance associated with them. Older vectorization techniques were incapable of handling punctuations and therefore they were dropped from the text data. Now, however, with the advance in NLP technology, we have much powerful embeddings that can actually very well handle punctuation symbols. Same goes for acronyms and parenthesis. Modern embeddings are pretrained on large set of documents with corpus size ranging in millions and even billions. Therefore, embeddings are powerful enough to correctly represent the acronyms and parenthesis and the data inside the parenthesis. Therefore, we are not removing the punctuation symbols, parenthesis. \n",
    "Ideally, acronyms should actually be expanded into their complete form and then fed to model, however, it is not possible in this case to come up with a finite set of acronyms that would suffice the problem at hand. Therefore, we are leaving them as it for the embeddings to handle."

When this stem word is obtained by truncating the last few characters or the  first few characters without bothering about semantic meaning, it is referred to as stemming. When the same procedure is followed in accord with grammar of the language and linguistics in such a way that final stemmed word obtained still has some semantic meaning assoicated with it and is an actual word, it is referred to as Lemmatization. \n",
